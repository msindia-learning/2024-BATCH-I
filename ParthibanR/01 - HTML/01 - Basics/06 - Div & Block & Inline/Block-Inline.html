    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline">BLOCK LEVEL:</h3>
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space a margin before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. Two commonly used block elements are p and div The p element defines a paragraph in an HTML document. The div element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>EXAMPLES:</h4>
    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

    <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline">INLINE LEVEL:</h3>

    <p style="text-indent:400px;">
         An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a span element inside a paragraph.Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The two most common display values are block and inline
