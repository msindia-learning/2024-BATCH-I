        <h3 style="color:white;"> 'Attack On Titan':</h3>
        <p style="color: white; text-indent: 190px; text-align: justify;">It's all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had. No matter how blessed a life you've lived. It's all the same if you're shredded by rocks. Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in us being born? Would you say that of our fallen comrades? Their lives...were they meaningless </p>
        <h3 style="color:white;"> 'Death Note':</h3>
        <p style="color: white; text-indent: 190px; text-align: justify;">There are many types of monsters that scare me: monsters who cause trouble without showing themselves, monsters who [take] children, monsters who devour dreams, monsters who suck blood... and then, monsters who tell nothing but lies. Lying monsters are a real nuisance: They are much more cunning than others. </p>
        <h3 style="color:white;"> 'Assassination Classroom':</h3>
        <p style="color: white; text-indent: 190px; text-align: justify;">I cut him down so he'll spring back up. The boy's enormously talented, there's no denying that. But he's a novice. He's not yet learned how to be worthy of that talent. He refuses to meet any challenge except on his own terms. He doesn't see the true value of competition. To a young person for whom everything comes easily, the pain of defeat can be a much needed wake-up call. </p>
        <h3 style="color:white;"> 'Naruto':</h3>
        <p style="color: white; text-indent: 190px; text-align: justify;">In the name of gain and profit for one's nation and village, Shinobi have hated and hurt each other for many years, from the first to the third Great Ninja War and the conflicts in between. All of that hatred cried out for power. Thus I was born. In the past I was hatred. And I was power. And a Jinchuuriki. I hated this world and all it's people and thought about destroying both. That's exactly what the Akatsuki is trying to do now... But then! A single Shinobi from the Hidden Leaf Village stopped me.</p>
