               Soil conditions are distinguished according to depth, fertility, and the presence of perennial roots. Soil depth is important because it determines the extent to which roots can penetrate into the earth and, therefore, the amount of water and nutrients available to the trees. The soil in the taiga is sandy and drains quickly. Deciduous forests have brown soil, richer than sand in nutrients, and less porous. Rainforests and savanna woodlands often have a soil layer rich in iron or aluminum, which give the soils either a reddish or yellowish cast. Given the vast amounts of rain they receive, the soil is often poor in tropical rainforests, as the nutrients are quickly leached away.

               The amount of water available to the soil, and therefore available for tree growth, depends on the amount of annual rainfall. Water may be lost by evaporation from the surface or by leaf transpiration. Evaporation and transpiration also control the temperature of the air in forests, which is always slightly warmer in cold months and cooler in warm months than the air in surrounding regions.

               The density of tree cover influences the amount of both sunlight and rainfall reaching every forest layer. A full-canopied forest absorbs between 60 and 90 percent of available light, most of which is absorbed by the leaves for photosynthesis. The movement of rainfall into the forest is considerably influenced by leaf cover, which tends to slow the velocity of falling water, which penetrates down to the ground level by running down tree trunks or dripping from leaves. Water not absorbed by the tree roots for nutrition runs along root channels, so water erosion is therefore not a major factor in shaping forest topography.

                   These types of forest trees can be beneficial for multiple purposes, and one of them is for medicinal use. The bark of this tree extracts fluid used as an astringent, which is beneficial in healing wounds.

                   Its fluid is also used to cure illnesses like malaria, anemia, diarrhea, and fever. Not only its bark has medicinal value, but its leaves also contain several limonoids and different types of 2-hydroxy-3-O-tigloylswietenolide and deacetylsecomahoganin.

                   <h2>Wood Purposes:</h2>
                   The wood acquired from this tree helps make furniture, fixtures, boat, caskets, etc. The wood of these type of trees are popular for making musical instrumentsâ€”for example, Drums, Guitar, Veena, etc.

                   <h2> The Black Walnut Forest Tree:</h2>
                   The Black Walnut is also botanically known as Juglans Nigra. As the name denotes, it belongs to the Walnut family.

                   As per the census, this tree is very important for commercial purposes. Its fruit and walnut are cultivated for food. Due to its attractiveness and strength of the woods, this is a type of forest tree that is highly used for wood working.

                   <h2>Nutritional purposes:</h2>
                   The Black Walnut tree produces nutritious and delicious walnuts. These walnuts are harvested in America, mostly from Missouri.

                   These nuts can be used in ice-creams, bakery goods, etc. Its high levels of proteins can be used as a garnishing element in your food.

                   <h2>Wood Uses:</h2>
                   Its bark is diamond-shaped in grey-black color. Wood from this tree is used for ornamental purposes because of its attractive pattern and deep color.

                   It is also used for building furniture, flooring, paddles, and other wood products.

                   The pressures of exponential population growth coupled with the consequential urban growth and infrastructure development the forests in NCT of Delhi had dwindled to a mere 22 sq km in 1993. This rampant deforestation eventually manifested in the devastating environmental degradation of the city. Hence, in order to protect and preserve the trees and thereby safeguard the environment, the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA) was passed on 12th October 1994 by the legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
