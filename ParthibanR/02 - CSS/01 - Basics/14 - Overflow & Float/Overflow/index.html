        The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area
    </p>

    <h3>Overflow-visible:</h3>

    <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box</p>

    <div>You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>
    <br>  <br>  <br>
    <h3>Overflow-hidden</h3>
