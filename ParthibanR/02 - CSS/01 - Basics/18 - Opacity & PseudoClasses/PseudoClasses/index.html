    <h3>Styling a link depending on state:</h3>

    <p><b><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">This is a link</a></b></p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective.</p>

    <p>You can use the ::first-line pseudo-element to add a special effect to the first line of a text. Some more text. And even more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more.</p>

    <p>You can use the ::first-letter pseudo-element to add a special effect to the first character of a text!</p>
