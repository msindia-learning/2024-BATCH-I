    <hr>
    <h3>The CSS math functions allow mathematical expressions to be used as property values. Here, we will explain the calc(), max() and min() functions.</h3>

    <p>Create a div that stretches across the window, with a 50px gap between both sides of the div and the edges of the window:</p>

    <div id="div1">Some text...</div>

    <h1>important</h1>
    <p>The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.</p>

    <p>This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

    <p class="myclass">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

    <p id="myid">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>
