    <h3>Background Color:</h3>
    <p>
        <b>The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.</b>
    </p>
    <h3>Background Image:</h3>
    <p>
        <b>
            The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

            By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
        </b>
    </p>
    <h3>Background Repeat:</h3>
    <p>
        <b>
            By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

            Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this.
        </b>
    </p>
    <h3>Background Attachment:</h3>
    <p>
        <b>The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed will not scroll with the rest of the page.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Background Shorthand:</h3>
    <p>
        <b>To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.</b>
