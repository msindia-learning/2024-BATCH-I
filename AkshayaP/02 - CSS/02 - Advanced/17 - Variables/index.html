        <p>A customer review is an evaluation of a product or service made by someone who has purchased and used, or had experience with, a product or service.
        Customer reviews are a form of customer feedback on electronic commerce and online shopping sites.</p>
        <p>Be authentic: Review your own experience, and explain what the place was like and the service you received. Try to be as accurate as possible, and include both the positive and negative
        aspects of your visit. Be respectful: Business owners often use feedback to improve their offerings.</p>
