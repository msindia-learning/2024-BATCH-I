    <h1>CITIES</h1>
    <p>A city is a human settlement of a notable size. The term "city" has different meanings around the world and in some places the
    settlement can be very small. Even where the term is limited to larger settlements, there is no fixed definition of the lower boundary 
    for their size.</p>
