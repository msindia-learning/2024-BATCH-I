<h>Web Development</h>
<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. 
    Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain 
    text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
<p>The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), 
    and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise 
    have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this 
    category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.</p>
