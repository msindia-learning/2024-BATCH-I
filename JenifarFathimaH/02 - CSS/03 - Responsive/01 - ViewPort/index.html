            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI systems use algorithms and data to analyze patterns, make predictions, and adapt to changing environments.
            <br /><br />
            AI technologies range from simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, involves neural networks with multiple layers, mimicking the structure and function of the human brain.
            <br /><br />
            AI applications span various domains, including healthcare, finance, transportation, entertainment, and more. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis tools, and facial recognition systems.
            <br /><br />
            While AI presents immense opportunities for innovation and efficiency, it also raises ethical concerns such as privacy, bias in decision-making, job displacement, and the potential for misuse. As AI continues to advance, it's crucial to ensure responsible development and deployment, balancing technological progress with ethical considerations for the benefit of society as a whole.
