    <div class="one">
        <p>
            Deforestation is the removal of forests and woodlands. It involves the clearing of trees for other uses, such as agriculture, ranching, or urbanization. Deforestation has many negative environmental and social consequences.
            One of the most significant consequences of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity. Forests are home to a wide variety of plants and animals, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. When forests are cleared, these species lose their habitat and are at risk of extinction.
            Deforestation also contributes to climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to regulate the Earth's climate. When forests are cleared, this carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.
            In addition, deforestation can lead to soil erosion, flooding, and droughts. Trees help to hold soil in place, and when they are removed, the soil is more easily eroded by wind and water. This can lead to landslides and mudslides, which can damage property and infrastructure. Deforestation can also disrupt the water cycle, leading to more frequent and severe floods and droughts.

    <div class="two">
        <p>
            Global warming is a serious threat to our planet, and it's something that we need to take action on now. The average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century, and it's projected to increase by another 2-4 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. This warming is caused by the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and make the planet warmer.
            The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases are released into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. They are also released when we clear forests, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
            Global warming is already having a significant impact on our planet. The sea level is rising, which is causing flooding and erosion in coastal areas. The number of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts, is also increasing. These events are causing widespread damage and loss of life.
