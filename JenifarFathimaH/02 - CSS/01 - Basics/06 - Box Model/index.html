        <p>
            Deforestation is the removal of forests and woodlands. It involves the clearing of trees for other uses, such as agriculture, ranching, or urbanization. Deforestation has many negative environmental and social consequences.
            One of the most significant consequences of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity. Forests are home to a wide variety of plants and animals, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. When forests are cleared, these species lose their habitat and are at risk of extinction.
            Deforestation also contributes to climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which helps to regulate the Earth's climate. When forests are cleared, this carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.
            In addition, deforestation can lead to soil erosion, flooding, and droughts. Trees help to hold soil in place, and when they are removed, the soil is more easily eroded by wind and water. This can lead to landslides and mudslides, which can damage property and infrastructure. Deforestation can also disrupt the water cycle, leading to more frequent and severe floods and droughts.
