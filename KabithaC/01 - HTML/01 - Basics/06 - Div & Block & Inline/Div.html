        India is now prepping for cutting-edge technologies including <div>
            5G, AI, blockchain, augmented reality & virtual reality, machine learning & deep learning, robots, natural language processing,
        </div> etc.
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to change the way we work and live. In view of its positive impact on the economy, the technology is being embraced by the countries across the world. Its proliferation is being regarded as part of the fourth industrial revolution. <div>The Government of India has also envisioned to support research and development </div> and adoption of such technologies. In view of the possible impact of AI on the economy and society and to come out with a policy framework on AI, MeitY constituted four committees on AI. Reports given by them are available on the MeitY website.

            As James and his team began to investigate the murder, they quickly realized that this case was not as straightforward as it seemed. The man had no identification on him, and no one in the town recognized him. Further investigation revealed that the man had been living in the mansion for years and had been the caretaker of the property

            <h2>Story 1 </h2>
            <p>The short story is usually concerned with a single effect conveyed in only one or a few significant episodes or scenes. The form encourages economy of setting, concise narrative, and the omission of a complex plot; character is disclosed in action and dramatic encounter but is seldom fully developed. Despite its relatively limited scope, though, a short story is often judged by its ability to provide a “complete” or satisfying treatment of its characters and subject..</p>

            <h2>Story 2 </h2>
            <p>The evolution of the short story first began before humans could write. To aid in constructing and memorizing tales, the early storyteller often relied on stock phrases, fixed rhythms, and rhyme. Consequently, many of the oldest narratives in the world, such as the ancient Babylonian tale the Epic of Gilgamesh, are in verse. Indeed, most major stories from the ancient Middle East were in verse: “The War of the Gods,” “The Story of Adapa” (both Babylonian), “The Heavenly Bow,” and “The King Who Forgot” (both Canaanite). Those tales were inscribed in cuneiform on clay during the 2nd millennium BCE..</p>

            <h2>Story 3</h2>
            <p>In the first half of the 20th century the appeal of the short story continued to grow. Literally hundreds of writers—including, as it seems, nearly every major dramatist, poet, and novelist—published thousands of excellent stories. William Faulkner suggested that writers often try their hand at poetry, find it too difficult, go on to the next most demanding form, the short story, fail at that, and only then settle for the novel. In the 20th century Germany, France, Russia, and the U.S. lost what had once appeared to be their exclusive domination of the form. Innovative and commanding writers emerged in places that had previously exerted little influence on the genre: Sicily, for example, produced Luigi Pirandello; Prague, Franz Kafka; Japan, Akutagawa Ryūnosuke; Argentina, Jorge Luis Borges. Literary journals with international circulation, such as Ford Madox Ford’s Transatlantic Review, Scribner’s Magazine, and Harriet Weaver’s Egoist, provided a steady and prime exposure for young writers.</p>
