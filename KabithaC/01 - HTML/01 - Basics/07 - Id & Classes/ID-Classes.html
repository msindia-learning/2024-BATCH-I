          <p>phone which fits perfect in hand with one of the best display, however everything becomes useless when you can't even hold the phone. While Gaming Video calling charging and sometimes randomly, the phone heats to much that you can barely hold it in your hand. you feel the unnecessary burning sensation in your denim pocket. This is such a shame that a phone with the highest specs becomes an oven within half an hour of video calling. Shame on Samsung. Exynos should not even exist. </p>
