            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, typically computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using that information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI encompasses a broad range of technologies and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more.
                Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, another subset, utilizes neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn from large amounts of data and perform complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
